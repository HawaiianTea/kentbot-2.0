the pictures made for the recipes work, but the prompt needs a bit of tuning to get the style how i want

the tts dj works, but is way too slow on weaker hardware. needs some kind of toggle, or just comment all the llm tts and re add the elevenlabs api.

some discord messages need tweaking. there does not need to be an added to queue message as there is already a queue message we can read. also said queue should delete itself when finished.
